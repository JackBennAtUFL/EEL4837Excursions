All of the code and functions for this excursion are included in the given exc2.cpp file. Due to this, there should not be any include path errors or similar issues.
To compile the file into an .exe file, run the line

g++ exc2.cpp -o ex2

The file was compiled with g++ version 14.2.0 but should not be limited by previous versions.

--Executing the file
After compiling the cpp file, the .exe file can be run using the given following command in command prompt. Ensure that the command is run in the directory that contains the files.

ex2.exe

The proper execution of the program relies on the presence of a input.txt file. Without this file, the program will return an error message. The output.txt file will contain the optimized cost of the desired logic equation. This file will be update if already present or created if it is not.

--Running the file
There are no user inputs required to run this file. Simply running the executable should run the program successfully.
